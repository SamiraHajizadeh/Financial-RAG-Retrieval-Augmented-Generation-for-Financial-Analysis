# Financial RAG

Financial RAG is a project that implements Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) techniques for financial analysis and information retrieval.

## Project Overview

This project aims to leverage the power of RAG to enhance financial data analysis and information retrieval. By combining large language models with a knowledge base of financial documents, we can provide more accurate and context-aware responses to financial queries.

## Features

- **Document Ingestion**: Efficiently process and store financial documents for quick retrieval.
- **Query Processing**: Analyze user queries and retrieve relevant financial information.
- **RAG Implementation**: Utilize state-of-the-art RAG techniques to generate accurate and contextual responses.
- **Financial Domain Specialization**: Tailored for financial use cases, including market analysis, risk assessment, and investment strategies.

## Installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/SamiraHajizadeh/Financial_RAG.git
cd Financial_RAG
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

Before running the code, make sure to **add your tokens in cell 4** of the Jupyter notebook. This step is crucial for authenticating your API requests and ensuring proper functionality.
