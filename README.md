# Financial Intelligence: RAG-Powered Investment Insights

## Overview

Financial Intelligence is an advanced Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) project designed to provide intelligent, context-aware financial analysis and insights. By combining cutting-edge language models with sophisticated information retrieval techniques, this project aims to transform how investors and financial professionals access and interpret complex financial data.

## Features

- **Intelligent Document Retrieval**: Leverages advanced semantic search to pull relevant financial documents and reports
- **Context-Aware Analysis**: Uses RAG techniques to generate nuanced insights from multiple source documents
- **Comprehensive Financial Coverage**: Supports analysis across various financial domains including:
  - Stock market trends
  - Company financial reports
  - Economic indicators
  - Investment strategy recommendations

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.8+
- Required libraries (see `requirements.txt`)
- OpenAI API key or alternative LLM provider credentials
- Vector database (e.g., Pinecone, Chroma)
